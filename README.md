# Severless Event Management

This serverless application is designed to foster meaningful connections within cities by providing a platform for organizing and participating in local events. The platform allows users to create events as hosts or join events organized by others. These events can range from sports and entertainment to everyday activities. A built-in map feature showcases the locations of events, making it easy for users to find nearby activities. Users can explore event details, view host profiles, and leave messages for hosts with questions or comments. After attending an event, users can rate the experience, providing valuable feedback for future participants.

With its serverless architecture leveraging AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway, the platform is highly scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. It eliminates the need for users to manage infrastructure, ensuring seamless operation and faster deployment of new features.

This platform is ideal for individuals seeking connections without the need to travel far. By providing communication tools and host ratings, it ensures users can join suitable and trustworthy events. Ultimately, the platform aims to help people lead richer, more fulfilling lives by engaging in shared experiences within their communities.
